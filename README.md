This is the source code for the final project for COMP 6630 at Auburn University Fall 2023. The source code includes the following models implemented: 

1. Decision Tree Classifier
2. Naive Bayes Classifier
3. Logistic Regression
4. Support Vector Machine
5. Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)

We have implemented all of these models using a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arvindnagaonkar/flight-delay) containing flight delay data. This dataset includes flight information from 2018-2023 from the Bureau of Transportation. The original set had more than 30 million entries and 40 attributes. We have selected 110,000 entries, 20 attributes, and 3 classes: early, on time, and late. Performance metrics are given for each model. Each model is implemented separately within a block. Our code can best be used by first running the blocks that import the data, and then running each model independently as you choose.
